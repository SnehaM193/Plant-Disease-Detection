# Plant Disease Detection Using CNN üå± 
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify and detect plant diseases from üåø leaf images. The model helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early, reducing crop loss and improving yield.




üöÄ Features

‚Ä¢ Image-based Classification: Identifies 15 different plant diseases from a simple photo of a leaf.

‚Ä¢ High Accuracy: The model is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset to achieve high performance.

‚Ä¢ User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit web app provides a simple and intuitive platform for users to get predictions.

‚Ä¢ Robust Training: The model incorporates advanced techniques like data augmentation and dropout to prevent overfitting and ensure reliable predictions on new, unseen da




üìÅ Dataset and Data Preprocessing

‚Ä¢ The model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset, a well-known public dataset for plant disease classification.

- Dataset Source: Kaggle - PlantVillage Dataset

- Data Split: The dataset was divided into:

- Training Set: 16,504 images

- Validation Set: 2,058 images

- Test Set: 2,076 images

‚Ä¢ Image Preprocessing: All images were resized to 128x128 pixels.

‚Ä¢ Data Augmentation: To improve the model's ability to generalize, the training data was augmented with random flips, rotations, and zooms.





üß† Model Architecture

‚Ä¢ The model architecture combines a powerful pre-trained model with a custom classification head.

‚Ä¢ Base Model: MobileNetV2, pre-trained on ImageNet. The last 100 layers of this model were unfrozen and fine-tuned on our dataset.

‚Ä¢ Classification Head: A custom-built classifier was added on top of the base model's output. It consists of:

‚Ä¢ A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer to flatten the feature maps.

‚Ä¢ A Dense layer with 512 neurons.

‚Ä¢ A Dropout layer (rate = 0.6) for regularization.

‚Ä¢ A final Dense layer with a softmax activation for multi-class prediction.
